        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>

          listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
          VoiceOver)

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public
        Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
      <p>The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.</p>
      <p>
        This website is partially compliant with the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2</a>
        AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>
          There is no timeout warning on pages within the service. This could make it more difficult for users who need
          more time to complete a task as they will have no indication that the service is going to time out. This fails
          WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.2.1 - 2.2.6 (enough time). We plan to fix this by November 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some pages have multiple headings of the same type (heading 1), meaning navigating with a screen reader could
          be confusing. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.6 (headings and labels). We plan to fix this by
          November 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some links in the service don’t have a text alternative that can be detected by assistive technology. This
          means that some links will not be detected by assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion
          1.1.1 (non-text content). We plan to fix this by November 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some error messages are not attached to the fields they relate to in the service. This means when navigating
          the page with assistive technology, the fields don’t show an error associated with them. This fails WCAG 2.2
          success criterion 3.3.1 - 3.3.6 (input assistance). We plan to fix this by November 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some error messages are not correctly formatted. This means errors are confusing and unclear, and text fields
          are sometimes not correctly highlighted. This could cause difficulty in recovering from the error. This fails
          WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.1 - 3.3.6 (input assistance). We plan to fix this by November 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          The record a video functionality contains pages with the same heading, and it is not coded correctly so people
          using assistive technology will miss information on this page. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.6
          (headings and labels), 3.3.1 - 3.3.6 (input assistance) and 1.3.1 (info and relationships). We plan to fix
          this by November 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of the back links lead to pages that are unexpected. This could cause people to get lost in the service.
          This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks). We plan to fix this by November 2025.
        </li>
